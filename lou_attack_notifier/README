This is a script that polls LOU and checks for incoming attacks on your
selected cities. When it detects incoming attacks it mails the coordinates of
the target, the city of the attacker and the time of arrival of the attack.
The script was originally intended to be used for people without defence
ministers but can also be used to help you in sending support to players
outside your alliance
